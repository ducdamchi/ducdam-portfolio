  "description": [
   "Three years before I took the first photo of this series, T and I had become friends in an international high school. I was the first Vietnamese that he met, and he was the first American to openly joke with me about the war. Halfway through his studies, T had to take an academic leave. Before leaving, he invited me to visit his home in New Mexico if I ever had the chance to.",
   "Picking me up at the Albuquerque airport was T and two new faces–his childhood friend, and a hitchhiker from Kentucky. They were both crashing at T’s section-8 one-bedroom apartment, located on the edge of a small town two hours North. After spending Christmas together, T and I decided to go on a road trip to meet someone we both knew from high school. Things went unexpectedly as I had kept T’s arrival a secret.",
   "This photo series is about leaving and being left behind in the vast landscapes of the American Southwest. The photographed subjects are in a constant state of arrival, yet in the very moment that they are captured, there is a seed of departure. This duality–of coming and leaving–can be abrupt and escapes understanding of the participant, its reverberations only to be experienced in the future tense.",
   "Regardless, in the stories that I have encountered on this journey, there is always a desire to seek stillness among ever-changing conditions--often without a promise of attainment. This desire is perfectly captured in a remark that T once made: 'I don’t mind the cold as long as it’s not windy. I don’t mind the clouds as long as it’s not windy. I don’t mind the snow as long as it’s not windy.'"

In the famous manga One Piece, the protagonist is known for always wearing a hat with the exact same pattern. Bringing a symbol of Japanese pop culture into iconic landscapes of the United States. C created a playful stage from two distinct cultural sentiments that captured, quite literally, a comical moment in globalization."

He’d just finished military service and returned to his village, home to a big population of the Vietnamese Lolo ethnic group. He introduced me to his family and L, his then fianceé. After drinking lots of homemade corn wine, I received an invitation to their wedding in October.",
   "Th and L had already had their engagement photo taken by a studio when I arrived. With days to spare, I wanted to offer a mundane perspective into the scenes behind their big ceremony–gatherings in the house, actions in the yard, and sometimes objects displayed on the wall. There was no catering services, which I think was only possible because everyone didn’t hesitate to roll up their sleeves. With only a thousand people in Lolo village, this was undoubtedly the spirit that bonded families and doubled enjoyments in both moments of labor and rest.",

   "Hanoi is a very busy city, where people being busy against the backdrop of other busy things has become the center thesis of many foreign photographers. However, there is also a local sentiment that is widely shared, but often unspoken: when the sun retreats to the horizon, people also desire a retreat from the chaos of the day. This desire creates a distinct sense of relief that many associate with the afternoon hours of Hanoi.",
   "For me, the temporal dimension of this sentiment is best captured not through people, but through signposts in which people sometimes are a part of. The vertical orientation of this series tries to mimic that precise effect of signposts–they stand vertically to isolate themselves from chaos, and quietly inform us of what’s about to come."

In this calendar, they wanted to showcase moments of teamwork and service that take place in the natural landscapes that housed their community",
