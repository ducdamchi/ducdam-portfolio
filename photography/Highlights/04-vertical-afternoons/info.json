    "Hanoi is a very busy city, where people being busy against the backdrop of other busy things has become the center thesis of many foreign photographers. However, there is also a local sentiment that is widely shared, but often unspoken: when the sun retreats to the horizon, people also desire a retreat from the chaos of the day. This desire creates a distinct sense of relief that many associate with the afternoon hours of Hanoi.",
    "For me, the temporal dimension of this sentiment is best captured not through people, but through signposts in which people sometimes are a part of. The vertical orientation of this series tries to mimic that same effect of signposts: standing vertically to isolate themselves from chaos, and quietly informing us of whatâ€™s about to come."
