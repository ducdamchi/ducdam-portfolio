  "description": [
    "This series follows C as he traveled through the American West carrying something special: a straw hat with a red ribbon. In the famous manga One Piece, the protagonist is known for always wearing a hat with the exact same pattern. Bringing a symbol of Japanese pop culture into iconic landscapes of the United States. C created a playful stage from two distinct cultural sentiments that captured, quite literally, a comical moment in globalization."
