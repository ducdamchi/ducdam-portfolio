    "In light of the 2020 Australian fires, a student-led Fire and Rescue Service team made a calendar as part of a fundraising and awareness campaign within their campus community. The team worked year-round to protect a biodiversity reserve that were prone to wildfires during its 7-month dry seasons. In this calendar, they wanted to showcase moments of teamwork that took place in the natural landscapes that housed their community",
    "These photos were captured during various service hours between 2018 and 2020, when I was a part of the team."
